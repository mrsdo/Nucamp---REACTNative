### Added json-server
Activities for this week are dependent on the json-server. The
server must be installed and running for the activities to work.

**To run the json-server use:**
json-server -H 0.0.0.0 --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000

**NOTE:**
TODO: Try typing s + to see what this does.

>  Type s + enter at any time to create a snapshot of the database
